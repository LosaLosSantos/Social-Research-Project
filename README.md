# Drug Consumption Analysis

This project analyzes drug consumption patterns based on personality traits and demographic data.

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Drug Consumption Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/drug-consumption-classification).

## Project Description

The project aims to analyze and visualize drug consumption patterns and to build a classification model to predict drug usage based on personality traits and demographic attributes.

### Attributes

- **Age**: Age of the participant, categorized into different age groups.
- **Gender**: Gender of the participant.
- **Education**: Level of education of the participant.
- **Country**: Country of residence of the participant.
- **Ethnicity**: Ethnicity of the participant.
- **Nscore**: Neuroticism score from NEO-FFI-R.
- **Escore**: Extraversion score from NEO-FFI-R.
- **Oscore**: Openness to experience score from NEO-FFI-R.
- **Ascore**: Agreeableness score from NEO-FFI-R.
- **Cscore**: Conscientiousness score from NEO-FFI-R.
- **Impulsive**: Impulsiveness measured by BIS-11.
- **Sensation**: Sensation seeking measured by ImpSS.

### Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distribution of drug usage across different demographic groups and personality traits.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Examine the correlation between personality traits and drug usage.
4. **Classification Model**: Build a classification model to predict drug usage based on the given attributes.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
